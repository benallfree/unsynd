<p>Whenever we make changes to these Terms, the changes are effective immediately after we post such revised Terms (indicated by revising the date at the top of these Terms) or upon your acceptance if we provide a mechanism for your immediate acceptance of the revised Terms (such as a click-through confirmation or acceptance button). It is your responsibility to check Unsynd.com for changes to these Terms.</p>

<p>If you continue to use the Service after the revised Terms go into effect, then you have accepted the changes to these Terms.</p>
