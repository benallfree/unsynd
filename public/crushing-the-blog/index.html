On the podcast, he was interviewed and gave an exclusive performance. People are listening and downloading and going nuts. But before you heard Jimi on the podcast, he wrote an article for the <strong>Unsynd Blog</strong>.</p><p>Writing an article for the <strong>Unsynd Blog</strong> opened the door. Jimi's article works for him day and night, building his online reputation by linking out to his social pages and site, and also by collecting email addresses of venues, fans, and other artists. <em>When we saw how professional Jimi was and how well he promoted his article, we wanted him on the podcast too</em>.</p><p>Between the podcast and the blog, Jimi's social reach blowing up like never before and he's receiving opportunities that he couldn't tap on his own. And it all started by writing an article for the <strong>Unsynd Blog</strong>.</p><div class="container text-center clearfix"><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="perspectives/surviving-the-road"><i class="fa fa-book"></i> Read Jimi's Article Now</a></div></div></div><div class="card"><h4 class="card-header">Why write an article?</h4><div class="card-block"><p>Imagine finding this in your inbox...</p><blockquote class="blockquote" style="font-family: monospace;">Hey (you), I read your article on the <strong>Unsynd Blog</strong> and checked out your music.

Thousands of people listen daily to discover new artists and new approaches to succeeding in the music business. On the day your <strong>Unsynd Blog</strong> article is published, the podcast listeners will know about it, too.</p></div></div><div class="card"><h4 class="card-header">How to crush the blog</h4><div class="card-block"><p>With a little luck and skill, your article might go viral and melt the Unsynd.com servers. (In actuality, the servers will never melt because Unsynd.com is powered by the biggest infrastructure partners in the world). Here is the step-by-step process to your success.</p><h5>Step 1: Choose a topic</h5><p>The article you write wants to pop. It wants to be unique, interesting, informative, personable, and in your own voice. Take a few hours to <a href="perspectives/">read our articles</a> so you can get a sense of how to write a successful article.</p><p>Think about a topic. The topic can be anything. If you need inspiration, take a look at the<a href="/blog-topic-ideas">big list of topic ideas</a> to get you started.</p><h5>Step 2: Choose a "goody" to provide that readers can download</h5><p>Let's say you the topic you choose is <em>How to Book Better Gigs</em>. In the article, you talk about how to evaluate venues, how to get paid, and how critical it is to have a personal relationship with your contact at the venue.</p><p>You write it, people read it. End of story? Hell no. You want their email addresses so you can continue building a relationship with your readers (your online audience). But people don't just give those away. But they will <em>trade</em> with you. Provide a goody for them to download, and you can get an email address.</p><p>In your case, maybe the goody is an Excel spreadsheet that you use to track your venues and contact information. Or maybe it's a PDF "cheat sheet" of important questions to ask venues. It's <em>bonus material</em> that readers won't find in your article, but that they can get by trading an email address.</p><p>When Unsynd.com collects an email address from someone who reads your article, it is forwarded to you. That way, you can start a personal conversation with them, add them to your own mailing list, or whatever else you'd like to do.</p><h5>Step 2: Pitch a one-paragraph proposal</h5><p>Seriously, just a paragraph. Describe what you want to write about and what your <em>goody</em> is.</p><p>Send your proposal to articles@unsynd.com for feedback. Don't burn time researching and writing an article that nobody wants to read or that can't be used for some other reason. You'll either get a Yes! or No! with suggestions toward something that is more likely to be successful for everyone.</p><h5>Step 3: Create your <em>goody</em> and send it to me</h5><p>After I green-light your proposal, create your goody.</p><p>Create your goody first. No goody, no article. It's really that simple, because Unsynd offers the best articles by artists who are excited to connect with readers. Unsynd works because we publish engaging content and resources for people.</p><p>When you send your goody, I'll give you feedback and encouragement.</p><h5>Step 4: Write a 500-800 word article and send it to me</h5><p>Once your goody is finished, write the article. 500-800 words is fine, you don't need to go crazy. Pay attention to spelling and grammar. Your article won't be published until the spelling and grammar are perfect.</p><p>If you would like to include links with your article, you can reference them at the end. I have to review any links we include in the article because outbound links affect our search engine status and "site authority".</p><p>I'll review your article and give you encouragement/feedback or tell you it's perfect and ready to publish.</p><h5>Step 5: Get the word out</h5><p>When your article is published, I will send you the article URL. Share this URL on social media, your mailing list, and anywhere else you can think to do it.</p><p>This is an important step. I'll be watching closely to see how popular your article is, where people are finding it, how many downloads you get, etc.</p><h5>Step 6: Get on the Unsynd Podcast</h5><p>If your article does well -- or rather, if you do well at it -- I will invite you to be a guest on our flagship podcast. The <strong>Unsynd Podcast</strong> connects you with Unsynd's largest and most active audience. Before you can get on the podcast, you must have a successful article published on the <strong>Unsynd Blog</strong>. I need to know that you are ready/willing/able to make it in the big leagues of the <strong>Unsynd Podcast</strong>.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="/crushing-the-podcast">crushing the podcast</a>.</p></div></div></div></div><footer><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col col-offset-2"><ul class="list-inline text-center"><li class="list-inline-item"><a href="mailto:benoit.benedetti@gmail.com"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-envelope-o fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li>
