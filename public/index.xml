      <description>How Jimi crushed itJimi Revolver has been featured on the Unsynd Podcast and the Unsynd Blog. On the podcast, he was interviewed and gave an exclusive performance. People are listening and downloading and going nuts. But before you heard Jimi on the podcast, he wrote an article for the Unsynd Blog.
