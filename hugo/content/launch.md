The Unsynd Blog is coming to your earbuds!

The **Unsynd Podcast** features interviews and performances by new and noteworthy artists and industry professionals who are making it happen without major record label support. I talk directly with successful people about what they are doing today to make it happen for themselves.

Once I've had 50 guest artists on the Unsynd Blog, I will begin producing the Unsynd Podcast.

#### How to get on the podcast
Interested in being featured on the podcast? Be one of the first 50 artists published in the **Unsynd Blog** and I'll promise you an episode on the Unsynd Podcast.
