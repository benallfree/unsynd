#### How Jimi Did It

<img src="/img/sized/cropped/100/artists/jimi-revolver/main.jpg" class="round pull-left mr-3"/> **Jimi Revolver** has been featured on the **Unsynd Podcast** and the **Unsynd Blog**. On the podcast, he was interviewed and gave an exclusive performance. People are listening and downloading and going nuts. But before you heard Jimi on the podcast, he wrote an article for the **Unsynd Blog**. 

Writing an article for the **Unsynd Blog** opened the door. Jimi's article works for him day and night, building his online reputation and collecting email addresses of venues, fans, and other artists. *When we saw how professional Jimi was and how hard he worked, we wanted him on the podcast too*.

Between the podcast and the blog, Jimi's social reach blowing up like never before and he's receiving opportunities that he couldn't tap on his own. And it all started by writing an article for the **Unsynd Blog**.

#### How You Can Do It
Imagine finding this in your inbox...

<blockquote class="blockquote" style="font-family: monospace">Hey (you), I read your article on the <strong>Unsynd Blog</strong> and checked out your music. I really like how you think and how your music comes across. You're clearly a professional. Would love to talk more about booking you next time you're in the Memphis area.</blockquote>

Writing for the **Unsynd Blog** is one of the most important steps you can take to spread your name and your music...

<h6 class="text-center">...if you do it right.</h6>

When people search for your name, or search for the topic you decide to write about, they will find their way to your **Unsynd Blog** article. From there, they will connect with you through your website, Facebook, Twitter, email, etc...

<h6 class="text-center">...if you do it right!</h6>

But it gets better. Imagine getting the email addresses of your readers. You might get 10, 20, 50, even 500 email addresses *every day* from people who read your article, loved it, and want to connect with you. Do you think that would help your career? It works, and it can work for you...

<h6 class="text-center">...if. you. do. it. right.</h6>

#### How to Do It Right

##### Step 1: Choose a topic

The article you write for us needs to pop. It needs to be unique, interesting, informative, personable, and in your own voice. Take a few hours to [read our articles](perspectives/) so you can get a sense of how to write a successful article.

Think about a topic. The topic can be anything. If you need inspiration, I made a [big list of topic ideas](/blog-topic-ideas) to get you started.

##### Step 2: Choose a "goody" to provide that readers can download

Let's say you the topic you choose is *How to Book Better Gigs*. In the article, you talk about how to evaluate venues, how to get paid, and how critical it is to have a personal relationship with your contact at the venue.

You write it, people read it. End of story? Hell no. You want their email addresses so you can continue building a relationship with your readers (your online audience). But people don't just give those away. But they will *trade* with you. Provide a goody for them to download, and you can get an email address.

In your case, maybe the goody is an Excel spreadsheet that you use to track your venues and contact information. Or maybe it's a PDF "cheat sheet" of important questions to ask venues. It's *bonus material* that they can't see in your article, but that they can get by trading an email address.

When Unsynd collects an email address from someone who read your article, we forward it to you. That way, you can start a personal conversation with them, add them to your own mailing list, or whatever else you'd like to do.

##### Step 2: Pitch a one-paragraph proposal to me

Seriously, just a paragraph. Describe what you want to write about and what your *goody* is.

Send your proposal to ben@unsynd.com so I can help you. Don't burn time researching and writing an article that nobody wants to read or that I can't use for some other reason. I'll take a glance at it and say Yes! or No! and steer you toward something that is going to be successful for both of us.

##### Step 3: Create your *goody* and send it to me

After I green-light your proposal, create your goody.

Create your goody first. No goody, no article. It's really that simple, because Unsynd offers the best articles by artists who are excited to connect with readers. Unsynd works because we provide engaging content and resources for people. 

When you send your goody, I'll give you feedback and encouragement.

##### Step 4: Write a 500-800 word article and send it to me

Once your goody is finished, write the article. 500-800 words is fine, you don't need to go crazy. Pay attention to spelling and grammar. Your article won't be published until the spelling and grammar are perfect.

If you would like to include links with your article, you can reference them at the end. I have to review any links we include in the article because outbound links affect our search engine status and "site authority".

I'll review your article and give you encouragement/feedback or tell you it's perfect and ready to publish.

##### Step 5: Get the word out

When your article is published, I will send you the article URL. Share this URL on social media, your mailing list, and anywhere else you can think to do it.

This is an important step. I'll be watching closely to see how popular your article is, where people are finding it, how many downloads you get, etc.

##### Step 6: Get on the Unsynd Podcast

If your article does well -- or rather, if you do well at it -- I will invite you to be a guest on our flagship podcast. The **Unsynd Podcast** connects you with Unsynd's largest and most active audience. Before you can get on the podcast, you must have a successful article published on the **Unsynd Blog**. I need to know that you are ready/willing/able to make it in the big leagues of the **Unsynd Podcast**.
